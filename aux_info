MP3 players.
Headphones and headsets.
Microphones.
Speakers .
And other audio devices, including some fairly traditional audio technologies.
If you plug speakers or mics or headsets into a primary device, with the possible exception of some types of USB setups, you’re typically connecting in through what you would call an auxiliary port.

Computer port 1 (COM1) on a traditional PC is typically configured as an audio aux port. which is the first serial port with a preconfigured assignment for serial devices.

An RS-232 standardization applies to various PC audio attachments, many of which are converted to the 3.5mm or “1/8 inch” standard audio jack on a lot of peripheral hardware.

Generally, the use of these audio ports requires different types of adapters and fittings for backward compatibility as system components evolve from many different manufacturers.
